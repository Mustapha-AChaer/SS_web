                                importantly, the community. This Terms of Service was drafted after consulting with
                                several lawyers, they strongly recommended we create one. We want to be as open and

                                <strong className="has-text-white">NFT:</strong> Non-fungible token is a commercial term
                                to describe items like your furniture, a picture image file, or your laptop. These
                                things are not interchangeable for other items because they have unique properties. NFTs
                                are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. They let us tokenize
                                things like art, collectibles, even real estate. They can only have one official owner
                                at a time and they're secured by the Ethereum blockchain – no one can modify the record
                                of ownership or copy/paste a new NFT into existence.
                                <br />

                                exchanged because their value defines them rather than their unique properties. For
                                example, ETH or dollars are fungible because 0.1 ETH / $1 USD is exchangeable for
                                another 0.1 ETH / $1 USD.

                                Fungible Token (NFT) created by validating the transaction. Each Surreal PFP is an NFT
                                on the Ethereum blockchain. When you purchase an NFT, you own all the rights to the
                                underlying Surreal PFP. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely and only by the Smart
                                Contract and the Ethereum Network which means that, at no point, may we seize, freeze,
                                or otherwise modify the ownership of any Surreal PFP’s.

                                purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace
                                that permits the purchase and sale of your SurrealSociety/NFT, provided that the
                                marketplace cryptographically verifies each Surreal Society owner’s rights to display
                                the Surreal PFP and ensures that only the actual owner can display the Surreal PFP; or
                                (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion,

                                purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Surreal PFP (“Commercial Use”).
                                Examples of such Commercial Use would be the use of the Surreal PFP to produce and sell

                                operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of Surreal PFP generally, provided

                                PFP; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the
                                inclusion, involvement, or participation of Surreal PFP generally, provided that the
                                third party website or application cryptographically verifies each Surreal PFP owner’s
                                rights to display the Surreal PFP and ensures that only the actual owner can display the

                                the Purchased Surreal PFP leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from
                                any of the foregoing.
