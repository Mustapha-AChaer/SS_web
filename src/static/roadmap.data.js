Additionally, our founders and investors will be putting their own ETH in the Surreal Community Wallet at random times! The awesome part about the Surreal Community Wallet is that it will be governed by all of our holders, meaning they will be able to vote on how we use over 300 ETH.',

With imaginative ideas, good execution, and the right team, we truly believe we can turn the Surreal Society into something special. The main part of this phase is introducing the Society YouTube channel, which will be very similar to MrBeast & MrBeast Gaming. Learn more about the structure of these events in Phase 6. Finally, we are going to start announcing things we are unable to announce pre-launch, which include ambitious marketing plans, partnerships, secret community rewards, new roadmap phases, timelines, and more.',

Each NFT will serve as an access token to this community. For the first year, we are going to spend 120 ETH towards these crazy, never seen before events. Each Month, members will have the ability to vote for different events, such as crazy competitions/challenges, project campaigns, real-life experiences, and so on. All of these crazy events will be filmed, edited by professionals, and uploaded to our YouTube channel (similarly to MrBeast & MrBeast Gaming). We believe this is a unique way of reaching a new audience and to spread awareness about the Society.',

All longtime Surreal Society NFT holders, who meet the requirements, will get airdropped a free NFT, that we have very special plans for. All we’ll say is that we suggest you hold onto your NFTs… more information regarding this soon.',
