                A Non-Fungible Token is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a digital ledger. NFTs
                can be used to represent easily-reproducible items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of
                digital files as unique items, and use blockchain technology to establish a verified and public proof of
                ownership.

                We believe the Surreal Society is extremely unique in its very own ways. Most importantly, the Surreal
                Society team has a long-term vision for this project. We truly want to build a special community that
                will be long lasting in the Web 3 world, also known as the Metaverse. Not only do we want to create a
                special community that will bring our members back every day, we want to bring as much value to all of
                our supporters as possible. Unlike the majority of projects today, we provide high-quality artwork, real
                utility, and we are completely transparent and doxxed. To learn more about our artwork, community, and
                utility, scroll up and check out the roadmap! The Surreal Society mission statement is to build an
                everlasting brand and community that will be a staple in the NFT community for years to come.

        question: 'What does the name "Surreal Society" come from?',
        answer: () => (
            <div className="has-text-hpurple3">
                Surrealism was a cultural movement which developed in Europe in the aftermath of World War I. The
                movement is best known for its visual artworks and writings and the juxtaposition of distant realities
                to activate the unconscious mind through the imagery. We believe the animations we are developing
                represent a true "surreal" look due to the high quality of each NFT, and how each NFT will be unique.

                We will announce a pre-sale and public-sale launch date relatively soonâ€¦ once the sale is live, you will
                connect your Metamask wallet to our website, and mint from there! If you do not know how to do this,
                that is okay! We will be supplying an in-depth tutorial very soon.

                The Pre-Sale price is 0.10 ETH + Gas. The Public-Sale price is 0.15 ETH + Gas. While our price may be
                higher than other projects, the value instilled in our NFT separates us from the others.

                The Surreal Society is powered by a registered company incorporated in the United States, which makes us
                responsible for the project before law and means that we have the legal responsibility to deliver on
                every commitment we make. The reason why we decided to do this is because we are very confident in our
                ability to execute, unlike 98% of projects nowadays.
