        description: 'Web 3.0 is here to stay. The historically fast rate at which the space is evolving can be very overwhelming. We are striving to create a strong and passionate community that can learn, grow, and benefit together during these exciting times. Each NFT will serve as an access token to one of the most desired, valuable, and exclusive communities in the Metaverse. The Society will be the go-to place for anyone who wants to learn and grow with like-minded people.'

        title: 'THE UTILITY',
        description: "Our mission statement is to provide as much value to all of our supporters as possible. As this space evolves, we want to evolve with it. Once all 5,000 Surreal Society NFTs have been minted, the Surreal Community Wallet will be funded with 300 ETH. Additionally, 10% of our secondary-sale royalties will be added to the Surreal Community Wallet. This Wallet will be governed by all of our holders. We will spend over 120 ETH towards events and experiences that'll be filmed and documented for our social media platforms. Learn more about these events by viewing our Roadmap."

        title: 'THE ARTWORK',
        description: 'Each NFT in this collection is 3 dimensional, animated, 1080p, and handcrafted. With over 100 high-quality traits, each NFT is unique in its very own way. We want everybody who owns a Surreal Society NFT to be in love with what they own. Holders will eventually have the ability to access their 3D animated files, and display them on automated artwork frames that will be given out. You will own full commercial rights to your Surreal Society NFT so long as you continue to own and control the NFT.'
